Please help me craft a professional yet human-sounding email response based on the following:

**Format:**
```
Email:
<received email>

Draft/Notes:
<my response draft, suggestions, or key points to include>
```

**Response Requirements:**
- Format as a complete email response (include greeting, body, and closing)
- Maintain the tone and structure of the original email
- Keep it concise but descriptive (2-3 paragraphs max)
- Sound professional but natural (avoid robotic/formulaic language)
- Address all key points from the original email
- Include any necessary details from my draft/key points
- End with an appropriate closing and signature

**Important:** 
- Match the level of formality of the original email
- If the original email was friendly, mirror that tone
- If it was more formal, maintain that professionalism
- Mirror formating of received mail when appropriate
- Builds rapport when appropriate
- Include proper spacing and formatting for readability
- ONLY output the formatted email response (no commentary or notes)
- Do not include any meta-commentary or notes
